title: About me
---

I am Silvan, an iOS developer working at [Mercedes-Benz.io](https://www.mercedes-benz.io) and am living in Berlin, Germany. I studied human-computer interaction (HCI) at the University of Hamburg and am interested in design, photography and technology.

I previously worked at [Wire](https://wire.com) and while studying was working at [XING AG](http://www.xing.com). I also enjoy listening to good podcasts and drinking a good craft beer from time to time. You can check out my pictures on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/silvandaehn) and get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/silvandaehn).

This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses a modified [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) theme.
