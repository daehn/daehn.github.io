title: About me
---

I am Silvan, an iOS developer living in Hamburg, Germany. I studied human-computer interaction (HCI) at the University of Hamburg and am interested in design, photography and technology.

Together with two friends I developed [Equal](http://equalapp.net/), a group expense managing application for iOS.
While studying I worked at [XING AG]("http://www.xing.com") as iOS developer (working student), and I still work as a drummer sometimes. I also enjoy listening to good podcasts and drinking a good craft beer from time to time.
